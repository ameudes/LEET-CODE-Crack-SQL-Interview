## Why this repository?

> *“If you can’t teach it, you don’t really understand it.”* — Feynman

Writing code once isn’t enough. By restating the problem, outlining a thought process, and then showing the query, I cement the concept. The habit is inspired by [this article](https://duncan-mcardle.medium.com/what-is-leetcode-and-why-do-i-post-solutions-to-it-on-medium-d40fb958bbc2).

Feel free to PR an alternative approach, optimisation, or edge-case test.
